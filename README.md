### Python - Data Analytics - Real World Hands-on Projects

These projects were completed as part of my course **Python - Data Analytics - Real World Hands-on Projects** on Udemy. The course focuses on applying Python to real-world data analysis scenarios using the **Pandas** library, among other tools. This repository contains the source code and datasets for each of the eight projects, which have provided me with practical insights and hands-on experience in data analysis.

The course covers several fundamental data analysis techniques, including data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization, using real-world datasets. Through this course, I have developed skills that are essential for a career in data analytics, including handling diverse datasets and performing advanced analysis with Python.

#### Key Projects Completed:

- **Weather Data Analysis**  
  Analyzing weather patterns and trends using publicly available datasets.

- **Cars Data Analysis**  
  Exploring data about various cars and conducting analyses to uncover insights related to performance, cost, and efficiency.

- **Covid Data Analysis**  
  Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing global data across multiple dimensions.

- **London Housing Data Analysis**  
  Analyzing real estate data to examine trends in the London housing market.

- **Census Data Analysis**  
  Exploring census data to identify trends in population demographics and related variables.

- **Udemy Data Analysis**  
  Analyzing Udemy course data to uncover patterns related to course popularity, ratings, and user feedback.

- **Netflix Data Analysis**  
  Conducting analysis on Netflix data to gain insights into viewing habits and trends.

#### Tools and Techniques Used:
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used extensively for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and graphical representation of findings.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The primary environment for running and documenting the projects.

#### What I Learned:
- How to handle and analyze large datasets using **Pandas**.
- How to visualize data effectively using **Matplotlib**.
- Techniques for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- How to draw insights from diverse datasets and apply data analytics techniques to real-world problems.

Each project in this repository reflects the hands-on application of Python-based data analytics, which has enhanced my skills and understanding of the field. These projects have also helped me build a portfolio that demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data and extract meaningful insights.
